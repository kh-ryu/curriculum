Starting from a variety of positions within the initial state space, the goal is to achieve and maintain an upright torso with minimal movement. The agent should apply torques to all joints to prevent the hopper from falling over, prioritizing minimal energy expenditure. Success is measured by maintaining a z height of the torso above a threshold (such as 1.2 times the initial z height) and keeping the torso angle within a limited range for a duration without falling or exceeding energy thresholds.\n",

The hops need to be smooth, controlled, and efficient, optimizing for forward speed while minimizing energy use and avoiding unhealthy states (falling, tipping over, or reaching unsafe angles).

      "Reason for fixing reward function: The learning curve demonstrates volatile progression with a steep drop in reward value, indicating potential instability in training or exploitation of the current reward function. The drop signifies that the reward function might not be robust against behaviors that are detrimental to the task goal. Additionally, the `hop_reward` and `healthy_reward` components max out easily, leaving no gradient for the agent to improve upon. The `forward_reward` plateaus quickly, while the `control_cost` has a relatively minor impact on behavior adjustment. To address these issues, we need a reward function that consistently incentivizes forward motion and hopping without saturation and provides a more balanced consideration of control costs.\n",

      "Reason: The task description specifies that the goal is to maintain vertical jumping and landing without progressing in the x-direction. Agent 1 has an average x position and x velocity of 0.0, with correspondingly zero standard deviations for x position and x velocity. This indicates that Agent 1 is successfully maintaining its position without moving horizontally. Additionally, Agent 1's average z position and small standard deviation for z position show consistent vertical movement within a limited range, which aligns with the goal of vertical jumping and landing in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, Agent 2 has a non-zero average x position and a significantly larger standard deviation for the x position, which indicates horizontal movement away from the starting x position. The standard deviation of x velocity is also substantial, illustrating variability in horizontal movement, further indicating that Agent 2 is not stationary in the x-direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the much larger standard deviation of Agent 2’s z position and z velocity compared to Agent 1 shows that Agent 2 is experiencing greater vertical displacement and speed variation, which could be indicative of non-optimal jumping and landing behaviors compared to the task requirements. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Agent 1 better fulfills the task criteria of staying in one place while jumping vertically.\n"
