This environment is Fetch-Slide environment
The original task in the environment is for a manipulator hit a puck in order to reach a target position on top of a long and slippery table.
The table has a low friction coefficient in order to make it slippery for the puck to slide and be able to reach the target position which is outside of the robotâ€™s workspace.
The robot is a 7-DoF Fetch Mobile Manipulator with a two-fingered parallel gripper.  
The gripper is locked in a closed configuration in order to perform the push task.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) end_effector_position: xyz position of end effector
(2) block_position: xyz position a block which robot should move
(3) block_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of block
(4) end_effector_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of end effector
(5) goal_position: Desired goal position in xyz coordinate 

In the original task, the task is marked as success if a distance between block position and goal position is less than 0.05.

Note that since the block is placed on a table, it has a fixed height of z = 0.42.
Note that goal position is also on a table, therefore, having a height of z = 0.42.
Note that xy coordinate goal position is initialized randomly and you cannot change it.
