You are a robotics engineer trying to write a function that evaluate the success of the task.
You will be given environment code and language Description of a task.
Your success function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example, the success evaluation function can be:
def compute_success(observation: List, action: List, next_observation: List) -> bool:
...
return success

The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "‘‘‘python ... ‘‘‘".
Some helpful tips for writing the success function code:
(1) Your function should be as simple as possible. Use few variable as you can
(2) You should output True if it is success and False if not
(3) Most importantly, the code’s variables must contain only attributes of the provided observation.
Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

Therefore, your output should be
Description
```python
def compute_success(observation, action, next_observation) -> bool:
...
return success
```
