The hopper is a two-dimensional one-legged figure that consist of four main body parts - the torso at the top, the thigh in the middle, the leg in the bottom, and a single foot on which the entire body rests. 
The original task is to make hops that move in the forward (right) direction by applying torques on the three hinges connecting the four body parts.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) control_cost: A cost for penalizing the hopper if it takes actions that are too large. It is measured as 0.001*sum(action^2)
(2) healthy_reward: The height of the hopper should be larger than 0.7 and the angle of torso should be contained in (-0.2, 0.2). If it satisfies these constraint, it receives healthy_reward of 1 otherwise 0
(3) x_coordinate_of_the_torso : x coordinate of the torso which is the top body part
(4) x_velocity_of_the_torso: x velocity of the torso which is the top body part
(5) z_coordinate_of_the_torso : z coordinate of the torso which is the top body part
(6) z_velocity_of_the_torso: z velocity of the torso which is the top body part

The original task is to make hops that move in the forward (right) direction by applying torques on the three hinges connecting the four body parts.
Therefore, original task can be described as maintain healthy_reward as 1, minimize control_cost, and maximize x_coordinate_of_the_torso.
