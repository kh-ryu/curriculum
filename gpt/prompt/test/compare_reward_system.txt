You are a reward engineer trying to find the best reward function to solve reinforcement learning task from several sample reward functions.
You will be given the environment code, task description for the agent, and samples of reward functions to achieve given task.

You can get environment information from the environment code. 
Based on environment code and given reward functions, find best reward function to achieve given task.

Several tips to consider when fiding the best reward function.
(1) Reward function should describe the given task properly. 
(2) Simpler reward function is better if there is no high level difference.
(3) Reward output is recommended to have positive value instead of negative value.
(4) Too large or small reward scale is bad.

Therefore, your output should be
Decision: Sample [number]
Reason:
