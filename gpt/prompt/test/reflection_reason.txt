Reason: The learning curve shows an improvement in the reward up to step 13 and then a significant drop, with a slight recovery afterwards. The drop from 3005.885 to 920.731 indicates that the agent had a trajectory that was counterproductive to learning the task, and it seems 
that the agent has not fully recovered even though the reward increased again after that incident. This suggests that the current reward function may lead to unstable learning, or the agent may have encountered an exploitation in the environment that yields high reward but does not align with the intended behavior.\n\n
Looking at the individual rewards:\n- The `hop_reward` and `healthy_reward` components are consistently hitting their maximum values, which may limit their effectiveness in guiding the agent's learning; they provide no further gradient for improvement once they've reached their maximum.\n- The `forward_reward` shows va
riations which suggest it is influencing the learning, but it also appears to hit a ceiling quickly.\n- The `control_cost` is relatively small compared to other components and relatively stable, which indicates it may not be heavily influencing the agent's action selection.\n\nIt is important to adjust the reward funct
ion so that it continues to guide the agent's behavior without creating plateaus that offer no further learning gradient. Increasing the sensitivity or scaling of the reward components so that they continue to provide useful training gradients could be beneficial. Moreover, investigating the reason for the significant 
drop in total reward may reveal specific issues with the agent's interaction with the environment that need to be addressed in the reward function.
