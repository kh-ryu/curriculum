Reason: The learning curve shows an improvement in the reward up to step 13, followed by a significant drop, which indicates the possibility of the agent engaging in undesirable behavior that is initially being rewarded but doesn't contribute to the actual task goal. Moreover, the `hop_reward` and `healthy_reward` components are consistently maxing out, suggesting they might not be effective in guiding learning, because once they reach their maximum, they don't contribute to the agent's ability to distinguish better from worse behaviors. The `forward_reward` reaching its maximum suggests a need for better scaling, and the stability of the `control_cost` suggests its influence may be too small to significantly impact agent behavior.

We should focus on creating a reward function where rewards are more tightly correlated with desirable behaviors and do not plateau so easily. The reward for hopping should ideally incentivize maintaining a target height range, not just upward velocity. The forward reward should scale with forward progress without exploding, ensuring a more consistent learning signal. The healthy reward can include penalties for straying outside of the desired angle range. The cost of control can be increased to more strongly penalize unnecessary energy expenditure, encouraging more efficient motions.

```python
def compute_reward(observation, action, next_observation) -> Tuple[np.float64, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    x_position_before = observation[0]
    x_position_after = next_observation[0]
    z_height_after = next_observation[1]
    angle_after = next_observation[2]
    
    forward_velocity_temp = 1.0
    forward_velocity = (x_position_after - x_position_before) / 0.05
    forward_reward = np.tanh(forward_velocity / forward_velocity_temp)  # Making the reward scale less extremely for speed
    
    target_height = 1.25  # Target z height for hopping
    height_deviation_temp = 0.5
    height_deviation = (target_height - z_height_after) ** 2
    hop_reward = np.exp(-height_deviation / height_deviation_temp)  # Encourages staying around the target height

    # Penalizing unhealthy angles
    angle_deviation_temp = 0.1
    healthy_angle_reward = np.exp(-np.square(angle_after) / angle_deviation_temp)

    # Increasing influence of control cost
    control_cost_coef = 0.3
    control_cost = control_cost_coef * np.sum(np.square(action))

    reward = forward_reward + hop_reward + healthy_angle_reward - control_cost
    
    return reward, {
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'hop_reward': hop_reward,
        'healthy_angle_reward': healthy_angle_reward,
        'control_cost': control_cost
    }
```

This revised reward function introduces a tanh scaling for forward velocity to ensure the agent gets a more consistent reward signal without hitting a maximum too quickly. It also includes a Gaussian penalty around a target height to encourage the agent to maintain a proper hopping height without only rewarding upwards movement. There's also a similar Gaussian-shaped reward for maintaining proper angles that are neither too large nor too small, encouraging stability. Lastly, control cost has been amplified to have a greater effect on the agent's policy, discouraging wasteful actions.
