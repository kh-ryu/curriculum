Reason for fixing reward function: The learning curve demonstrates volatile progression with a steep drop in reward value, indicating potential instability in training or exploitation of the current reward function. The drop signifies that the reward function might not be robust against behaviors that are detrimental to the task goal. Additionally, the `hop_reward` and `healthy_reward` components max out easily, leaving no gradient for the agent to improve upon. The `forward_reward` plateaus quickly, while the `control_cost` has a relatively minor impact on behavior adjustment. To address these issues, we need a reward function that consistently incentivizes forward motion and hopping without saturation and provides a more balanced consideration of control costs.

```python
def compute_reward(observation, action, next_observation) -> Tuple[np.float64, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    x_velocity = (next_observation[0] - observation[0]) / 0.05
    z_velocity = (next_observation[1] - observation[1]) / 0.05 
    
    # Parameters for reward transformations
    forward_reward_temp = 1.0  # Keep as-is since fluctuations show that it's influencing learning
    hop_reward_temp = 0.5      # Increase sensitivity, so it doesn't plateau too quickly
    health_temp = 0.5          # Increase sensitivity as with hop_reward_temp
    control_cost_temp = 10     # Increase impact to avoid negligible cost

    # Compute individual reward components
    forward_reward = np.exp(x_velocity / forward_reward_temp) - 1  # Subtract 1 to ensure 0 reward for 0 velocity

    # Penalize negative z_velocity to discourage downward motion
    hop_reward_raw = max(z_velocity, 0)
    hop_reward = (np.exp(hop_reward_raw / hop_reward_temp) - 1) if hop_reward_raw > 0 else -1 

    # Make healthy_reward more sensitive to unhealthy states, moving away from binary approach
    z, angle = observation[1:3]
    health_penalty = (abs(angle) + abs(z - 1.25))  # Assumes 1.25 is the upright z position
    healthy_reward = np.exp(-health_penalty / health_temp) 

    control_cost = np.sum(np.square(action)) / control_cost_temp

    # Compute the total reward
    reward = forward_reward + hop_reward + healthy_reward - control_cost

    # Collect individual reward components for analysis
    reward_components = {
        'healthy_reward': healthy_reward,
        'forward_reward': forward_reward,
        'hop_reward': hop_reward,
        'control_cost': control_cost
    }

    return reward, reward_components
```

The modifications made include adding an exponential transformation to the `hop_reward` and `healthy_reward` with adjusted temperature parameters to maintain reward gradients for improvement. The `forward_reward` now has a baseline subtraction to differentiate between static and moving states. Furthermore, the `control_cost` is amplified, making it a more significant deterrent against excessive action values. The healthy_reward computation is now continuous, giving smoother gradients for postures close to the ideal upright position. The changes aim to provide a more continuous gradient for learning while preventing premature reward saturation and making the control cost more impactful.
