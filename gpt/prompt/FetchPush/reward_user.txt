This environment is Fetch-Push environment
The original task in the environment is for a manipulator to move a block to a target position on top of a table by pushing with its gripper. 
The robot is a 7-DoF Fetch Mobile Manipulator with a two-fingered parallel gripper.  
The gripper is locked in a closed configuration in order to perform the push task.

Observation from self.obs() includes
(1) end_effector_position: xyz position of end effector
(2) block_position: xyz position a block which robot should move
(3) block_relative_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of block - Linear velocity of end effector
(4) end_effector_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of end effector
(5) goal_position: Desired goal position in xyz coordinate 

Your output for the reward code should follow this format
```python
def compute_reward_curriculum(self):
    end_effector_position, block_position, block_relative_linear_velocity, \
    end_effector_linear_velocity, goal_position = self.obs()

    # Implement your reward function here
    reward = np.zeros(1)

    return reward
```

Note that the block is placed on a table with a fixed height of z = 0.42.
Note that goal position is also on a table with a height of z = 0.42, while xy position is initialized randomly.
