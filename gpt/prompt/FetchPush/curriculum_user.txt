This environment is Fetch-Push environment
The original task in the environment is for a manipulator to move a block to a target position on top of a table by pushing with its gripper. 
The robot is a 7-DoF Fetch Mobile Manipulator with a two-fingered parallel gripper.  
The gripper is locked in a closed configuration in order to perform the push task.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) end_effector_position: xyz position of end effector
(2) block_position: xyz position a block which robot should move
(3) block_relative_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of block - Linear velocity of end effector
(4) end_effector_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of end effector
(5) goal_position: Desired goal position in xyz coordinate 

In the original task, the task is marked as success if a distance between block position and goal position is less than 0.05.
Therefore, original task can be described as minimizing the distance between block position and goal position.

Since the block is placed on a table, it has a fixed height of z = 0.42.
Also, goal position is also on a table, therefore, having a height of z = 0.42, while xy position is initialized randomly.
