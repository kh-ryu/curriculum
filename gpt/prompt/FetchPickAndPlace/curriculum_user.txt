This environment is Fetch-Pick and Place environment
The original task in the environment is for a manipulator to grip the block on the table and move to a target position on top of a table or in mid-air. 
The robot is a 7-DoF Fetch Mobile Manipulator with a two-fingered parallel gripper.  
The gripper can be opened or closed in order to perform the graspping operation of pick and place.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) end_effector_position: xyz position of end effector
(2) block_position: xyz position a block which robot should move
(3) gripper_distance: Joint distance of the right and left gripper finger
(4) block_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of block
(5) end_effector_linear_velocity: Linear velocity of end effector
(6) goal_position: Desired goal position in xyz coordinate 

In the original task, the task is marked as success if a distance between block position and goal position is less than 0.05.

Note that since the block is placed on a table, it has a fixed height of z = 0.42 when it is initialized.
Note that goal position can be mid-air over the table with a range of height [0.42, 0.87].
Note that xy coordinate goal position is initialized randomly and you cannot change it.
