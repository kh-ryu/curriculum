This is a learning curve for task: {TASK}
Analyze the learning curve and recommend between three options.
(1) Move to next task
(2) Continue training
(3) Revise the reward function

{REWARD_REFLECTION_HERE}

Some tips for decision makings
(1) If the reward has increased significantly compared to the beginning and converged, move to next task.
(2) If the reward has been increasing and not yet converged, keep training on same reward function.
(3) If the reward is not increasing, then you must rewrite the reward functions.
(4) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
(a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
(b) Re-writing the reward component
(c) Discarding the reward component
(5) If some reward componentsâ€™ magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
