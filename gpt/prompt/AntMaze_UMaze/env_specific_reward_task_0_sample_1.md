Task 1 Name:
Basic Locomotion

Task 1 Description:
The objective is to maximize the ant's torso velocity in the direction towards the goal position to achieve efficient locomotion without any restrictions on the ant's movements.

```python
def basic_locomotion_reward(self, ant_obs: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.float64, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Define the reward components
    reward_components = {
        'velocity_reward': 0.0
    }

    # Get the torso velocity
    torso_vel = self.torso_velocity(ant_obs)

    # Define weight for the torso velocity component
    tors_vel_weight = 1.0

    # Direction towards the goal position
    goal_direction = self.goal_pos()[:2] - self.torso_coordinate(ant_obs)[:2]
    # Normalize the goal direction
    goal_direction = goal_direction / np.linalg.norm(goal_direction)

    # Project torso velocity on the goal direction
    velocity_projection = np.dot(torso_vel[:2], goal_direction)
    # Utilize tanh to softly bound the reward and avoid reward explosions
    reward_components['velocity_reward'] = np.tanh(velocity_projection) * tors_vel_weight

    # Calculate total reward
    total_reward = sum(reward_components.values())

    return np.float64(total_reward), reward_components
```
This function computes the reward based on the velocity of the ant's torso in the direction of the goal. It penalizes movements that aren't in the direction of the goal, and it yields higher rewards for higher velocities towards the goal. The reward component related to velocity is softly bounded using the tanh function to avoid extremely large reward values that could negatively impact the learning process.
