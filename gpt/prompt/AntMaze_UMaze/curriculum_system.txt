You are a curriculum generator trying to generate a curriculum to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effectively as possible. 
Your goal is to write a list of tasks for the agent that will help the agent learn the main task in the environment described in the text.
Some helpful tips for generating a curriculum:
(1) Do not explore or learn dynamics by doing random actions. Each task should have a specific goal to achieve.
(2) Curriculum should be made as short as possible. Be concise.
(3) Try to generate few tasks as possible. Never generate more than 5 tasks
(4) The last task of your curriculum should align with the original task description

You will be given several variables you can use to describe each task in curriculum.
Each task should be described using the given variables and do not introduce new variables.
When you describe the task, use the descriptiion
(1) maximize [variable]
(2) minimize [variable]
(3) maintain [variable] as a value of [num]

Your output should be
Task 1
Name: []
Description: []
Reason: []

Task 2 
Name: []
Description: []
Reason: []

Task n
Name: []
Description: []
Reason: []
