Task 4 Name
Navigation and Turning

Task 4 Description
The objective is for the ant to adjust its torso_orientation to face multiple random goal positions (goal_pos) without the need to physically reach the goals. This task focuses on the ant's ability to align itself with the desired direction, a crucial capability for navigation, especially in a maze setting.

    # Constants
    orientation_weight = 2.0
    coordinate_weight = 1.0
    forward_weight = 1.0
    distance_weight = -0.5  # Penalize for goal distance to avoid reaching the target
    turning_weight = 1.0

    # Component Rewards
    reward_components = {}

    # Get information from observations
    torso_coordinate = self.torso_coordinate(ant_obs)
    torso_orientation = self.torso_orientation(ant_obs)
    goal_position = self.goal_pos()
    torso_velocity = self.torso_velocity(ant_obs)

    # Coordinate component (encourage maximizing torso's X-coordinate for forward movements)
    coordinate_reward = np.tanh(torso_coordinate[0])  # Mostly interested in X-coordinate for forward movement
    reward_components['coordinate'] = coordinate_reward * coordinate_weight

    # Velocity component (encourage movement)
    velocity_reward = np.linalg.norm(torso_velocity)
    forward_reward = np.tanh(velocity_reward)  # Encourage the ant moving forward
    reward_components['forward'] = forward_reward * forward_weight

    # Orientation component (encourage ant to turn and face the goal)
    # For simplicity, we'll turn the ant to face the direction of the goal along the horizontal plane
    # by comparing the vector to the goal with the ant's forward vector (which corresponds to its orientation)

    orientation_reward = np.tanh(direction_dot_product)  # Reward aligned orientation with goal direction
    reward_components['orientation'] = orientation_reward * orientation_weight

    # Turning speed component (encourage ant to quickly turn towards the goal)
    # Assuming we want to monitor the angular velocity about the z-axis for turning
    turning_speed = torso_orientation[5]  # Taking the z-component for turning speed
    turning_reward = np.tanh(turning_speed)  # Encourage faster turning
    reward_components['turning'] = turning_reward * turning_weight
