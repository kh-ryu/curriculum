The ant is a 3D robot consisting of one torso (free rotational body) with four legs attached to it with each leg having two body parts.
The original task in the environment is for ant to reach a target goal in a closed maze.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) torso_coordinate: xy coordinate of the torso
(2) torso_orientation: xyzw orientation of the torso
(3) torso_velocity: xy velocities of the torso
(4) torso_angular_velocity: xyz angular velocities of the torso
(5) goal_pos: final xy goal position of the ant
(6) goal_distance: distance between final goal and current torso position.

In the original task, the task is marked as success if a distance between torso xy position and goal xy position is less than 0.45.
Therefore, the original task can be described as making goal_distance as 0.45.

Note that in the starting state where the ant is standing still, torso_orientation is [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0].
torso_coordinate, torso_velocity, and torso_angular_velocity is initialized as [0.0, 0.0, 0.0].
goal_pos is initialized randomly.

Maze is in [[-5, 5], [-5, 5]] squre.
From center to left is blocked with the wall, making rotated U shape.
Therefore, we can say area around [[-5, 1], [-2, 2]] is blocked.
