The ant is a 3D robot consisting of one torso (free rotational body) with four legs attached to it with each leg having two body parts.
The original task in the environment is for ant to reach a target goal in a closed maze.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) torso_coordinate: xy coordinate of the torso
(2) torso_orientation: xyzw orientation of the torso
(3) torso_velocity: xy velocities of the torso
(4) torso_angular_velocity: xyz angular velocities of the torso
(5) goal_pos: final xy goal position of the ant
(6) goal_distance: distance between final goal and current torso position.
(7) goal_dist_threshold: Maximum distance between ant's initial position and goal position

You can set up the maximum distance between goal position and ant's initial position during the curriculum.
Note that the maximum distance that can have in maze is 8.0 and minimun threshold is 5.0
You also can remove such threshold by setting this variable as None

In the original task, the task is marked as success if a distance between torso xy position and goal xy position is less than 0.45.

Note that in the starting state where the ant is standing upright, torso_orientation is [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0].
Note that goal_pos is initialized randomly and you cannot change it.
Note that you cannot change maze configuration or detect a collision to the wall.
