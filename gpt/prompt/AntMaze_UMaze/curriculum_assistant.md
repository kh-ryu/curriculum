Task 1
Name: Basic Movement
Description: maximize torso_velocity
Reason: This task aims to teach the ant basic movement skills. Increasing torso velocity will ensure it can move from its initial position, which is crucial for later tasks requiring navigation towards a goal.

Task 2
Name: Orientation Maintenance
Description: maintain torso_orientation as a value of [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
Reason: Maintaining a stable orientation is crucial for effective movement and navigation through the maze. This task ensures the ant learns how to stabilize itself, which is essential for performing precise movements towards the goal.

Task 3
Name: Angular Velocity Control
Description: minimize torso_angular_velocity
Reason: This task teaches the ant to control and minimize its angular velocity. A lower angular velocity is important for precision and stability, especially in a maze environment where sudden changes in direction can lead to failure.

Task 4
Name: Navigation to Intermediate Goals
Description: minimize goal_distance with intermediary goal_pos
Reason: Before tackling the final goal in a complex maze, learning to navigate to intermediate goals is useful. This task will teach the ant to effectively adjust its path and strategies in real time to reach specific locations, preparing it for the unpredictability of the final maze layout.

Task 5
Name: Final Goal Navigation
Description: minimize goal_distance as 0.45
Reason: This task combines all skills learned in prior tasks to achieve the ultimate goal of reaching the final target in the maze. It emphasizes precise control, stability, and effective navigation, simulating the conditions of the original task in a complex environment.
