Your goal is to write a list of tasks for the agent that will help the agent learn the main task in the environment described in the text.

(1) Do not explore or learn dynamics by doing random actions. Each task should have a specific goal to achieve.
(2) Curriculum should be made as short as possible Be concise.
(3) Do not generate more than 5 tasks
(4) Your final task should be original task

You will be given several variables you can use to describe each task in curriculum.
Each task should be described using the given variables and do not introduce new variables.
When you describe the task, use the word
(1) maximize [variable]
(2) minimize [variable]
