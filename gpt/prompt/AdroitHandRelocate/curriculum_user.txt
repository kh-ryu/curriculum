The environment is based on the Adroit manipulation platform, a30 degree of freedom system which consists of a 24 degrees of freedom ShadowHand and a 6 degree of freedom arm. 
The original task in the environment is to be completed consists on moving the blue ball to the green target. 
The positions of the ball and target are randomized over the entire workspace. The task will be considered successful when the object is within 0.1-ball of the target.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) arm_position: Translation position of the arm in xyz direction
(2) arm_angular_position: Angular position of arm
(3) wrist_angular_position: Angular position of writst
(4) angular_position_forefinger: Angular position of joint of the forefinger joints in the order of horizontal MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, and vertical MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle), DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip)
(5) angular_position_middlefinger: Angular position of joint of the middlefinger joints in the order of horizontal MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, and vertical MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle), DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip)
(6) angular_position_ringfinger: Angular position of joint of the ringfinger joints in the order of horizontal MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, and vertical MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle), DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip)
(7) angular_position_littlefinger: Angular position of joint of the littlefinger joints in the order of CMC (carpometacarpal) joint, horizontal MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, vertical MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle), DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip)
(8) angular_thumb: Angular position of the thumb joints in the order of Horizontal CMC (carpometacarpal) joint, Vertical CMC (carpometacarpal) joint, horizontal MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, vertical MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint, IP (Interphalangeal) joint
(9) positional_difference_ball: xyz positional difference from the palm to the ball, palm_position - ball_position
(10) positional_difference_target: xyz positional difference from the palm to the target, palm_position - target_position
(11) positional_difference_from_ball_to_target: xyz positional difference from the ball to the target, ball_position - target_position

In the original task, the task is marked as success if a distance between target and ball is less than 0.1.
Therefore, the original task can be described as minimizing the positional_difference_from_ball_to_target.

The ball is set randomly over the table at reset. While table height is z = 0.0, center of ball has height z = 0.035 because of its own size.
The target position is also sampled from uniform distributions with ranges `[-0.2,0.2]` for the `x` coordinate, `[-0.2,0.2]` for the `y` coordinate, and `[0.15,0.35]` for the `z` coordinate.
However, we don't know the exact target position. We only have relative positional difference of target relative to the ball or the palm. 
All joints values are initialized as zeros, which is unfolded hand.
