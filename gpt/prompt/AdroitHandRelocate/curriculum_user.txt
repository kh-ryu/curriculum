The environment is based on the Adroit manipulation platform, a30 degree of freedom system which consists of a 24 degrees of freedom ShadowHand and a 6 degree of freedom arm. 
The original task in the environment is to be completed consists on moving the blue ball to the green target. 
The positions of the ball and target are randomized over the entire workspace. The task will be considered successful when the object is within 0.1-ball of the target.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes
(1) arm_position: Translation position of the arm in xyz direction
(2) arm_angular_position: Angular position of arm
(3) wrist_angular_position: Angular position of writst
(4) mcp_angular_position_forefinger: Angular position of MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint of the forefinger
(5) pip_angular_position_forefinger: Angular position of PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle) joint of the forefinger
(6) dip_angular_position_forefinger: Angular position of DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip) joint of the forefinger
(7) mcp_angular_position_middlefinger: Angular position of MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint of the middlefinger
(8) pip_angular_position_middlefingler: Angular position of PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle) joint of the middlefinger
(9) dip_angular_position_middlefinger: Angular position of DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip) joint of the middlefinger
(10) mcp_angular_position_ringfinger: Angular position of MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint of the ringfinger
(11) pip_angular_position_ringfinger: Angular position of PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle) joint of the ringfinger
(12) dip_angular_position_ringfinger: Angular position of DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip) joint of the ringfinger
(13) cmc_angular_position_littlefinger: Angular Position of the CMC (carpometacarpal) joint of the little finger
(14) mcp_angular_position_littlefinger: Angular position of MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint of the littlefinger
(15) pip_angular_position_littlefinger: Angular position of PIP(proximal interphalangeal, middle) joint of the littlefinger
(16) dip_angular_position_littlefinger: Angular position of DIP(Distal Interphalangeal, tip) joint of the littlefinger
(17) cmc_angular_thumb: Angular position of CMC (carpometacarpal) joint of the thumb
(18) mcp_angular_position_thumb: Angular position of MCP(metacarpophalangeal, knuckle) joint of the thumb
(19) ip_angular_thumb: Angular position of the IP (Interphalangeal) joint of the thumb
(20) positional_difference_ball: xyz positional difference from the palm to the ball, ball_position - palm_position
(21) positional_difference_target: xyz positional difference from the palm to the target, target_position - palm_position
(22) positional_difference_from_ball_to_target: xyz positional difference from the ball to the target, target_position - ball_position

In the original task, the task is marked as success if a distance between target and ball is less than 0.1.
Therefore, the original task can be described as minimizing the positional_difference_from_ball_to_target.

The ball is set randomly over the table at reset. The ranges of the uniform distribution from which the position is samples are `[-0.15,0.15]` for the `x` coordinate, and `[-0.15,0.3]` got the `y` coordinate.
The target position is also sampled from uniform distributions with ranges `[-0.2,0.2]` for the `x` coordinate, `[-0.2,0.2]` for the `y` coordinate, and `[0.15,0.35]` for the `z` coordinate.
