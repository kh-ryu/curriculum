The hub is a bipedal robot that can walk and run in a fashin similar to that of humans or animals.
The original task in the environment is for hub to walk in x direction with speed of 1m/s.
This is identical with following a command that consist of [linear velocity x, linear velocity y, angular velocity yaw, heading angle]
with linear velocity x = 1.0, linear velocity y = 0.0, and head angle = 0.0
Angular velocity command is generated from heading error to help a robot follow given heading angle.

You can change the value of command for the curriculum.

Note that in the starting state where the hub is standing still, the position of the body base is [0.0, 0.0, 0.515].
Default joint angles are initialized to make hub stand.

The environment is terminated if their torso gets contact with the floor.

There are elemantary reward functions available.
Available reward functions are
lin_vel_z: Penalize z axis base linear velocity
ang_vel_xy: Penalize xy axes base angular velocity
orientation: Penalize if base orientation is not flat
base_height: Penalize if base height is away from stable height
torques: Penalize torque actions
dof_vel: Penalize dof velocities
dof_acc: Penalize dof accelerations
action_rate: Penalize changes in actions
collision: Penalize collisions on bodies
termination: Penalize for termination before time out
dof_pos_limits: Penalize dof positions that is too close to the limit
dof_vel_limits: Penalize dof velocities too close to the limit
torque_limits: Penalize torques too close to the limit
tracking_lin_vel: Reward for tracking linear velocity command in xy direction
tracking_ang_vel: Reward for tracking angular velocity commands in yaw
feet_air_time: Reward for long steps which makes feet on the air for long time
stumble: Penalize feet for hitting vertical surfaces
stand_still: Penalize if there is a motion even if at zero commands
feet_contact_forces: Penalize high contact forces
no_fly: Reward if all feet is on the air
high_freq: Penalize high frequency actions
default_joint_angles: Penalize if joint angles are away from default
hip_pos: Penalize if hip position is away from default
foot_pos: Penalize if foot position is away from default
