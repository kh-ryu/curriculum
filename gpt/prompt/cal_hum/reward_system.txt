You should write reward function for given task using given elemantary reward functions.
You should write new reward function based on elemantary reward functions, by modifying weights on each function.
Your reward function is part of the curriculum learning consist of learning sequence of different tasks.
You will be given description of past tasks, reward weights for past tasks, and current task descriptiion.

Your reward function will be attached to given configuration file.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "‘‘‘python ... ‘‘‘".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
(1) You may put higher weight on the reward related to current task. However, you should also give reward for past tasks to avoid forgetting.
(2) Do not use other function names that is not given as an available functions.
(3) Only return code without any redundant explanation.
(4) Given reward functions are scaled to have similar values, except for large penalty on termination.
(5) If the values are already assigned in given format, never change it.
(6) If a reward function is penalizing it, its weight should be negative. On the other hand, if a reward function is motivating it, its weight should be positive.
(7) Robot always should avoid high frequency action that can make robot unstable.
(8) Robot should avoid dof position, dof velocity, and torque values going beyond the limit, which can lead to system failure.
