The hub is a bipedal robot that can walk and run in a fashion similar to that of humans or animals.
The original task in the environment is for hub to walk in x direction with speed of 2m/s.
This is identical with following a command that consist of [linear velocity x, linear velocity y, angular velocity z, heading angle]
with linear velocity x = 2.0, linear velocity y = 0.0, and anglular velocity = 0.0
Angular velocity command is generated from heading error to help a robot follow given heading angle.

Note that you can change the value of linear velocity x, linear velocity y, and heading angle command for each subtask.
Note that the default initial values are initialized to make hub stand.
Note that you should try to follow command linear velocity, angular velocity z, and heading angle.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes

base_lin_vel: Linear velocity of base in xyz direction
base_ang_vel: angular velocity of base in xyz axes
torques: Torques applied to the joint 
hip_pos_deviation: Relative position of hip joint from default standing position
knee_pos_deviation: Relative position of knee joint from default standing position
base_height_diff: height difference between measured base height and default stainding height
nonflat_base_orientation: Size of deviation of base orientation from default standing position
joint_vel: Velocity of each joint
joint_acc: Acceleration of each joint
is_alive: 1 if the environment is healthy, 0 if the environment is terminated due to failure.
commands: Value of commands that robot base should follow. 
          Consist of [linear velocity x, linear velocity y, angular velocity z].
          Angular velocity z is automatically generated from command heading angle and current head angle.
