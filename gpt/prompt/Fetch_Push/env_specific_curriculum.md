Task 1 
Name: Align End Effector with Block
Description: make [End effector xyz position] as [Block xyz position]
Reason: This task will help the agent learn how to maneuver the end effector to the exact position of the block, which is a critical skill for pushing the block effectively towards the goal.

Task 2 
Name: Match End Effector Velocity with Block
Description: make [End effector linear velocity in xyz direction] as [Block linear velocity in xyz direction relative to end effector]
Reason: Ensuring the end effector moves at the same velocity as the block (initially zero) will teach the agent the precision needed in controlling its speed and direction, important for gentle and accurate pushes.

Task 3 
Name: Reduce Distance to Goal
Description: minimize [distance between Block xyz position and Desired goal position in xyz coordinate]
Reason: This task focuses on the core objective of the original task - moving the block towards the goal. By minimizing the distance between the block and the goal, the agent learns to push the block in the correct direction.

Task 4 
Original Task: Move Block to Target Position
Original Task Description: The agent must manipulate a block to a target position on the table by pushing it with a gripper. The task is considered successful if the block's position is within 0.05 units of the target position. This requires precise control over the manipulator's movement and velocity, as well as strategic planning to push the block towards the goal efficiently.
