Task 1 Name: Align End Effector with Block

Task 1 Description: Make [End effector xyz position] as [Block xyz position]. This task will help the agent learn how to maneuver the end effector to the exact position of the block, which is a critical skill for pushing the block effectively towards the goal.

```python
def align_end_effector_with_block(self) -> Tuple[np.float64, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    end_effector_pos = self.end_effector_position()
    block_pos = self.block_position()
    
    # Calculate the distance between the end effector and the block
    distance = np.linalg.norm(end_effector_pos - block_pos)
    
    # Reward function parameters
    distance_weight = 1.0  # Weight for the distance penalty
    
    # Reward for aligning the end effector with the block
    # We use the negative distance because lower distance is better, hence we want to minimize the distance
    reward = -distance_weight * distance
    
    # Individual reward components
    reward_components = {
        'distance_penalty': -distance  # Negative distance as lower distance is desired
    }
    
    return reward, reward_components
