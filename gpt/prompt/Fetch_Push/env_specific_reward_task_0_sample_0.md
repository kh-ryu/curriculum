Task 1 Name: Align End Effector with Block
Task 1 Description: Make [End effector xyz position] as [Block xyz position]. This task will help the agent learn how to maneuver the end effector to the exact position of the block, which is a critical skill for pushing the block effectively towards the goal.

```python
def align_end_effector_with_block(self) -> Tuple[np.float64, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Extract the positions of the end effector and the block
    end_effector_pos = self.end_effector_position()
    block_pos = self.block_position()
    
    # Compute the distance between the end effector and the block
    distance = np.linalg.norm(end_effector_pos - block_pos)
    
    # Define a weight for the distance penalty
    distance_weight = 1.0

    # Compute the reward based on the distance. The closer the end effector is to the block, the higher the reward.
    reward = -distance_weight * distance

    # Create a dictionary to store the components of the reward
    reward_components = {"distance_to_block": -distance}

    return reward, reward_components
```
