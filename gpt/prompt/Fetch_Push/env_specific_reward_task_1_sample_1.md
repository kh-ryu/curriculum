Task 2 Name: Match End Effector Velocity with Block
Task 2 Description: Make the end effector's linear velocity in xyz direction the same as the block's linear velocity in xyz direction (relative to the end effector). This ensures that the end effector moves at the same velocity as the block, facilitating precise and controlled pushes.

```python
def match_end_effector_velocity_with_block(self) -> Tuple[np.float64, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Fetch the end effector's and block's linear velocities
    end_effector_velocity = self.end_effector_linear_velocity()
    block_velocity = self.block_relative_linear_velocity()

    # Compute the velocity difference between the end effector and the block
    velocity_difference = np.linalg.norm(end_effector_velocity - block_velocity)

    # Convert this difference into a reward signal
    # The goal is to minimize this difference, so we use -np.tanh() to achieve this
    velocity_difference_weight = 1.0  # This weight can be adjusted to scale the reward's impact
    reward = -np.tanh(velocity_difference_weight * velocity_difference)

    # Create a dictionary for detailed reward component tracking, if necessary
    reward_details = {
        "velocity_difference": velocity_difference,
        "reward_velocity_matching": reward
    }

    return reward, reward_details
