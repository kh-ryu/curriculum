Task 1 Name: Align End Effector with Block

Task 1 Description: Make the [End effector xyz position] the same as the [Block xyz position]. This task will help the agent learn how to maneuver the end effector to the exact position of the block, which is a critical skill for pushing the block effectively towards the goal.

```python
def align_end_effector_with_block(self) -> Tuple[np.float64, Dict[str, np.float64]]:
    # Retrieve the current position of the end effector and the block
    end_effector_pos = self.end_effector_position()
    block_pos = self.block_position()
    
    # Calculate the L2 distance between the end effector and the block
    distance_to_block = np.linalg.norm(end_effector_pos - block_pos)
    
    # We want to minimize this distance, so we use negative tanh as the transformation function
    # This makes sure that the closer the end effector is to the block, the higher (less negative) the reward
    distance_reward_weight = 1.0  # You can adjust this weight to make the reward component more or less significant
    distance_reward = -np.tanh(distance_reward_weight * distance_to_block)
    
    # Total reward is simply the distance reward in this task
    reward = distance_reward
    
    # Breakdown of the reward components for analysis
    reward_breakdown = {
        "distance_to_block_reward": distance_reward
    }
    
    return reward, reward_breakdown
