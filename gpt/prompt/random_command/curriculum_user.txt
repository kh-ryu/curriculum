The hub is a bipedal robot that can walk and run in a fashin similar to that of humans or animals.
The original task in the environment is for hub to walk or run by following random command.
Speed of the hub robot will be specified in a command consist of [linear velocity x, linear velocity y, heading angle]
The command range in original task should follow this: "linear velocity x: [-2, 2] , linear velocity y: [-2, 2], angular velocity z: [-1, 1] heading angle is [-pi, pi]"

In each subtask, you can train the agent for randomized command with specific command range.
You have to specify the range of command value in the task description.

Note that the default initial values are initialized to make hub stand.

The variables you can use to describe the curriculum includes

base_lin_vel: Linear velocity of base in xyz direction
base_ang_vel: angular velocity of base in xyz direction,
nonflat_base_orientation: Size of deviation of base orientation from default standing position, 
base_height_diff: height difference between measured base height and default stainding height, 
torques: Torques applied to the joint,
hip_pos_deviation: Relative position of hip joint from default standing position,
knee_pos_deviation: Relative position of knee joint from default standing position, 
joint_vel: Velocity of each joint, 
joint_acc: Acceleration of each joint, 
is_alive: 1 if the environment is healthy, 0 if the environment is terminated due to failure, 

commands: Range of commands that robot base should follow. 
          Consist of [linear velocity x range [], linear velocity y range [], angular velocity z range [], heading angle range []].
